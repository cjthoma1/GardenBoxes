Garden Boxes

* Written in Ruby
* Using Rspec for testing 
* Given a length, width and a Vegetable from veggie array we can determine how many of selected vegetables we can plant;
* Ex: length of 5, width of 5 and and Turnip (position 8 in our array) allows the user to plant 50 turnips 
(area = l * w )
(Turnip_Sqft = 2)
(area * Turnip_Sqft = 50)
